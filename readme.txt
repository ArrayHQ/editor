= Installing Jetpack =
Jetpack is a WordPress plugin by Automattic, the folks who make WordPress. It’s a toolkit that provides various features and enhancements to your WordPress site. Editor utilizes several features (infinite scroll, carousel, etc.) of Jetpack, and must be installed for the theme to work as you see in the demo.

* Install Jetpack by going to Plugins → Add New and search for “Jetpack”. Install and activate the plugin. Once installed, you can enable Jetpack by

* Click the connect button and log in to a WordPress.com account to authorize the Jetpack connection.
If you don’t yet have a WordPress.com account, you can quickly create one after clicking the connect button.
* Once installed, activated, and connected to WordPress.com, you can visit the Jetpack settings page, which is now available at the top of your admin menu. Editor utilizes the following modules:

Carousel – The Carousel adds a beautiful lightbox carousel to your gallery images. This can be seen on the gallery posts on the homepage of the demo.

Contact Forms – Add a contact form to your posts or pages with the Contact Form module.

Tiled Galleries - With Tiled Galleries you can display your image galleries in three new styles: a rectangular mosaic, a square mosaic, and a circular grid.

Infinite Scroll – Infinite Scroll is a feature that loads the next set of posts automatically when visitors approach the bottom of the home page or posts page.

----------

= Contact Page =
Editor utilizes Jetpack’s contact form module for adding contact forms to your pages.

* Firstly, make sure the Contact Form module is activated on the Jetpack page.
* Go to Pages → Add New to create a new page to use as the contact page.
* To create a contact form, click the contact form icon above the post editor. Visit the Jetpack Contact Form page (http://jetpack.me/support/contact-form/) for more information on how to create a contact form.
* Publish the page when finished.

----------

= Widgets =
The widget section of Editor is located in the sidebar as a hidden menu. You can view your widgets by clicking the folder icon in Editor’s sidebar menu.

----------

= Creating Media Posts =
Editor makes it easy to share your images, videos, and quotes.

** Featured Image Posts **

* Create a new post and add a title and description.
* Write your content and add whatever styling you want.
* On the right hand side of your page, you’ll see the Featured Image pane. Click Set Featured Image and upload your image. Once uploaded, scroll down and click Use as featured image. Once set, you can close the image upload window.

= Post Styles =
Editor comes with a few custom element styles, which are used to easily add extra styling to your WordPress posts.

** Pull Quotes **

Pull quotes are similar to block quotes, but are reserved for less text. See Editor’s Style Guide to see the suggested usage. To use pull quotes you can add a class of pull-left or pull-right to your content. See an example below.

<span class="pull-right">This text will be pulled right.</span>

** Text Highlight **

Text highlight simply adds a yellow background to your text, useful for in-paragraph emphasis. To use the highlight style, you can add a class of highlight to your content. See an example below.

<span class="highlight">This text will be highlighted.</span>
